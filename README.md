# GitHub Tour & Markdown Practice
Familiarize yourself with GitHub and Markdown syntax with this practice assignment.

## The GitHub Homepage
When you open a repository (repo) on GitHub, you'll be first greeted by the repo's homepage:

Note a few of the key areas in the screenshot above.

## Using the GitHub Markdown Editor
Click on any of the files in the file listing to preview, open, or edit it. For Markdown files (usually identified by their `.md` file extension) you can use GitHub's build-in Markdown editor, allowing you to make changes to repo files right in the web browser:

Toggle between the **Edit** and **Preview** tabs to check your work:

## Committing Changes
Make sure to **commit changes** at logical stages, such as when a particular section is completed. Write an informative **commit message** about what changes were made. You can leave the extended description blank.

# Your Assignment
## Recreate the History of Hip Hop Music
Try to recreate [this file](screenshot_00-history_complete.jpg) on the history of hip hop music by using raw Markdown syntax. 

Begin with the [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) file, which already contains the raw text for you. It's your job to add the formatting using the appropriate Markdown symbols.

## Additional Tricky Examples
This [link](tricky-examples.md) has five more tricky examples of Markdown formatted text. Can you re-create them faithfully without looking up the syntax?
